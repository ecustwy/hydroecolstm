.. Installation

HydroEcoLSTM was developed based on many other packages. To avoid conflict with other pre-installed packages, create a virtual environment to install HydroEcoLSMT and its dependencies. To do that, we could install Anaconda from `here <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_. Then open the cmd command and execute the following code:

.. code-block:: console

    conda create -n hydroecolstm_env
    conda activate hydroecolstm_env
    pip install git+https://github.com/tamnva/hydroecolstm.git
